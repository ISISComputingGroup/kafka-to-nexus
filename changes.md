# Changes

*Add to release notes and clear this list when creating a new release*

- `use-hdf-swmr` and `abort-on-uninitialised-stream` are now CLI options rather than configurable per job in the Kafka start command.
- Using the `graylog-logger` library as a spdlog module is now the default. Set CMake option `USE_GRAYLOG_LOGGER=OFF` to disable.
- CMake "find modules" are now generated by Conan and therefore not required in this repository, disabling Conan (CMake option `CONAN=DISABLE`) and providing your own find modules is still possible.
- The following dependencies have been updated:
  - spdlog-graylog
  - spdlog
  - librdkafka
  - fmt
  - trompeloeil
